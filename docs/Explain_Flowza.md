# 🍳 Flowza: The AI/ML Kitchen

## Pitch Analogy

**Traditional ML workflow** = You have to buy all appliances separately (datasets, preprocessing scripts, ML models, deployment code). It takes effort, setup, and expertise.

**Flowza** = A fully-equipped kitchen for AI/ML.

### Kitchen Components

- **🧊 Fridge** = Data ingestion (CSV, Postgres, S3)
- **🔥 Oven/Stove** = ML models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost, etc.)
- **🔪 Knives/Tools** = Preprocessing nodes (drop nulls, normalize, encode)
- **📖 Recipes** = Workflow templates (classification, regression)
- **👨‍🍳 Chef assistant** = AI-generated workflows (prompt → working pipeline)

**End result**: Anyone can come in, pick ingredients, follow a recipe (or make their own), and serve a dish (trained model, predictions, deployed API) quickly.

## ⚙️ Typical ML Workflow → Sub-Processes

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- **Data Cleaning** → Handle missing values, duplicates, noisy data
- **Data Transformation** → Normalization, standardization, scaling
- **Data Integration** → Merge multiple data sources
- **Data Reduction** → Feature selection, dimensionality reduction (PCA, LDA)
- **Data Encoding** → One-hot encoding, label encoding, embeddings
- **Outlier Handling** → Z-score, IQR method, isolation forest
- **Data Splitting** → Train/validation/test split, cross-validation

### 2. Feature Engineering

- **Feature Creation** → Domain-based new features, ratios, polynomial features
- **Feature Extraction** → PCA, LDA, autoencoders
- **Feature Selection** → Filter methods (correlation, chi-square), wrapper methods (RFE), embedded methods (Lasso, XGBoost importance)
- **Handling Temporal/Sequential Features** → Lag features, rolling windows (time-series)
- **Text Feature Engineering** → Bag of Words, TF-IDF, word embeddings
- **Categorical Feature Handling** → Frequency encoding, target encoding

### 3. Model Selection

- **Baseline Models** → Dummy classifier/regressor, simple linear model
- **Traditional ML Models** → Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM
- **Deep Learning Models** → CNNs, RNNs, Transformers (when applicable)
- **Automated Model Selection** → Grid search, AutoML frameworks
- **Evaluation-Based Choice** → Compare models on accuracy, F1, RMSE, ROC-AUC

### 4. Model Training

- **Define Loss Function** → MSE, Cross-Entropy, Hinge Loss, etc.
- **Optimizer Selection** → SGD, Adam, RMSProp
- **Batching Strategy** → Mini-batch, online learning
- **Regularization** → L1, L2, dropout, early stopping
- **Parallel/Distributed Training** → GPUs, TPUs, Horovod, Dask

### 5. Model Validation

- **Train-Test Split Validation**
- **K-Fold Cross Validation**
- **Stratified Cross Validation** (for imbalanced data)
- **Nested Cross Validation** (for hyperparameter + performance estimation)
- **Metrics Calculation** → Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC, RMSE, MAE, R²
- **Error Analysis** → Confusion matrix, misclassification patterns

### 6. Hyperparameter Tuning

- **Grid Search**
- **Random Search**
- **Bayesian Optimization** (Hyperopt, Optuna, BOHB)
- **Genetic Algorithms / Evolutionary Strategies**
- **Automated Hyperparameter Tuning** (AutoML)
- **Early Stopping** in tuning loops

### 7. Model Deployment

- **Model Serialization** → Pickle, Joblib, ONNX, TorchScript
- **Serving Approaches**:
  - REST API (FastAPI, Flask, Django)
  - gRPC endpoints
  - Batch inference pipelines
- **Containerization** → Docker, Kubernetes
- **Monitoring & Logging** → Track latency, throughput, errors
- **Model Versioning & Registry** → MLflow, custom Postgres registry
- **Scaling** → Load balancing, autoscaling (K8s, serverless)
- **Model Retraining Workflow** → Schedule retraining jobs (Airflow, Celery)

## 🍳 Use Case: Sales Prediction in the AI Kitchen

### 🏢 The Company's Goal

They want an AI model to predict future sales, so they can stock inventory efficiently and reduce losses.

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. 🥬 Gathering Ingredients (Data Ingestion)

- From their sales database (Postgres, ERP system) → import historical sales data (dates, product IDs, quantities)
- From marketing data (CSV, S3, CRM) → promotions, seasonality, discounts
- From external sources → holidays, weather (if relevant)

*Kitchen analogy: Bringing ingredients into the kitchen fridge.*

#### 2. 🔪 Preparing the Ingredients (Data Preprocessing)

- **Cleaning** → handle missing sales entries, remove duplicates
- **Transformation** → normalize values (e.g., scale revenue numbers)
- **Encoding** → convert product categories into numbers
- **Outlier handling** → remove sudden one-time spikes (like clearance sale)
- **Splitting** → split data into train/test

*Kitchen analogy: Washing, chopping, and marinating ingredients before cooking.*

#### 3. 🧂 Designing the Recipe (Feature Engineering)

- Create time-based features → day of week, month, holiday flags
- Create lag features → sales in past 7/30 days
- Create rolling averages → moving average of last 3 months
- Encode promotional campaigns as binary flags

*Kitchen analogy: Mixing ingredients creatively to enhance flavor.*

#### 4. 🍳 Choosing the Appliance (Model Selection)

- Try simple models first (Linear Regression, Decision Trees)
- Then try more powerful ones (XGBoost, LSTM for time-series)
- Compare performance with cross-validation

*Kitchen analogy: Deciding whether to use an oven, pressure cooker, or air fryer for the recipe.*

#### 5. 🔥 Cooking the Dish (Model Training)

- Train selected models with training data
- Use optimizers & regularization to avoid overfitting
- Run multiple training experiments

*Kitchen analogy: Actually cooking the meal using chosen appliance.*

#### 6. 👅 Taste Test (Model Validation)

- Validate on unseen test data
- Metrics: RMSE (for sales prediction error), MAPE (percentage error)
- Analyze prediction errors for seasonal dips/spikes

*Kitchen analogy: Tasting the dish to check flavor balance before serving.*

#### 7. 🧄 Adjusting the Recipe (Hyperparameter Tuning)

- Use grid search / Optuna to tune learning rate, tree depth, etc.
- Select best performing parameters

*Kitchen analogy: Adjusting spice levels, baking time, seasoning.*

#### 8. 🍽️ Serving the Dish (Model Deployment)

- Deploy trained model as a REST API via FastAPI
- Integrate with company's inventory system:
  - **API input** → latest sales, promotions, seasonality
  - **API output** → next week/month's predicted sales
- Setup monitoring for accuracy and retraining

*Kitchen analogy: Serving the dish to guests at the table.*

#### 9. 📝 Feedback Loop (Monitoring & Retraining)

- Monitor prediction accuracy vs. actual sales
- Log inputs/outputs in database
- Schedule automatic retraining every month with new sales data

*Kitchen analogy: Getting guest feedback and improving the recipe for next time.*
